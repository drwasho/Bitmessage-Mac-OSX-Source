Bitmessage OSX Mac Source

I have basically followed the instructions at https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Compiling_instructions. All of the files were NOT written by me, you can find the original project at: https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage

To create your own .app for Bitmessage, open the terminal and navigate to your PyBitmessage folder (where the osx.sh file is located). Then type in the following command: "./osx.sh 1".

The app will be created in the /src/dist/ folder. So far this has only worked for 10.8.x users.

If it works, feel free to send me your favorite pasta recipe: BM-2D8EEkLGncpzXdarWG3rmMJxsHue2VJCcB
